WebChat provides a seamless messaging experience, packed with modern features to connect users instantly. Here’s a deep dive into the app's capabilities:

- **🛠️ Friend & Group Management**: Users can send **friend requests** and easily manage their connections. Create and join groups for seamless collaboration and discussion.
- **📁 Media Sharing**: Share images, videos, and files directly within your chat, with automatic previews for easy viewing.
- **🔐 Secure Authentication**: Login securely, ensuring user data protection and privacy across all devices.

## Admin Panel

- **📊 Message Monitoring**: Admins can view and monitor messages within the platform, ensuring a safe and healthy communication environment.
- **👥 Group & User Management**: Admins can manage groups, view active users, monitor user activity (message counts, online status), and take action if necessary.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React ⚛️, RTK Query 📦 (for optimized state management and API calls), Socket.io 📡 (for real-time communication)
- **Backend**: Node.js 🌐, Express 🚀, MongoDB Atlas 📚 (for scalable data management)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and reliable user login.

## Responsive & Scalable Design

- **📱 Mobile & Desktop Friendly**: WebChat is fully responsive, ensuring a flawless experience on all screen sizes.
- **⚙️ Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle large volumes of users and messages, ensuring a smooth experience even during peak usage.

This project combines real-time messaging with robust user management and admin controls, making it ideal for both personal and professional communication needs. I’m proud of the performance and flexibility it offers, and I’m eager to hear feedback from the community! 🙌
